    "- You are welcome to discuss the problems with your classmates but __you are not allowed to copy any part of your answers from your classmates.  Short code snippets are allowed from the internet.  Code from the class text books or class provided code can be copied in its entirety.__\n",
    "- There could be tests in some cells (i.e., `assert` and `np.testing.` statements). These tests (if present) are used to grade your answers. **However, the professor and FAs could use __additional__ test for your answer. Think about cases where your code should run even if it passess all the tests you see.**\n",
    "- Before submitting your work, remember to check for run time errors with the following procedure:\n",
    "`Kernel`$\\rightarrow$`Restart and Run All`.  All runtime errors will result in a minimum penalty of half off.\n",
    "- Data Bricks is the official class runtime environment so you should test your code on Data Bricks before submission.  If there is a runtime problem in the grading environment, we will try your code on Data Bricks before making a final grading decision.\n",
    "- All plots shall include a title, and axis labels.\n",
    "- Grading feedback cells are there for graders to provide feedback to students.  Don't change or remove grading feedback cells.\n",
    "- Don't add or remove files from your git repo.\n",
    "- Do not change file names in your repo.  This also means don't change the title of the ipython notebook.\n",
    "- You are free to add additional code cells around the cells marked `your code here`.\n",
    "- Students may use toPandas() to print the head of data frames.\n",
    "- __Only use spark, spark machine learning, spark data frames, RDD's, and map reduce to solve all problems unless instructed otherwise.__"
